## Introduction

These guidelines focus on our brand that includes our logo, color palette, typography, system elements and imagery. They will help us create communications that project our unique brand in a consistent manner.

Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout Axway, whether applications or experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage. The following concepts are the foundation as we strive to achieve balance and harmony through our User Interface Design. 
The Colors distinguishes our brand and helps us to create consistent experiences across marketing and products. We use color in meaningful ways in all expressions of our brand. From showing the colorful complexity of teaming up at a high level all the way down to focused, meaningful colors in a product, we use color to pinpoint exactly what people need to see.

We are committed to complying with AA standard - [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/)

In order to meet the standard, well-defined hierarchy and extended the palette that support usability. This ensures sufficient color contrast between elements so that users with low vision can see and use our products.

## Colors usage & palettes

The Design color system helps you apply color to your UI in a meaningful way. In this system, you select a primary and a secondary color to represent your brand. Dark and light variants of each color can then be applied to your UI in different ways. 

### Principles
* __Hierarchical__ - Color indicates which elements are interactive, how they relate to other elements, and their level of prominence. Important elements should stand out the most.
* __Legible__ - Text and important elements, like icons, should meet legibility standards when appearing on colored backgrounds.
* __Expressive__ - Show brand colors at memorable moments that reinforce your brand’s style.

### Color theme 

This includes default colors for: 
* Primary and secondary colors 
* Variants of primary and secondary colors 
* Additional UI colors, such as colors for backgrounds, surfaces, errors, typography, and iconography. 

## Hierarchy

The color draws attention to specific elements on-screen. When an element’s color contrasts with its surroundings, that element stands out, so users can tell it’s important. Because color themes vary – from bold and bright, to monochromatic or muted – there are different ways to indicate which elements have greater importance. 

For example, black icons stand out when they are placed against a white background. Multicolored cards draw attention to themselves when placed next to monochromatic colors. 

Surface contrast is used to bring attention to important events, use stronger color contrasts between elements. 

### Primary color

The primary color is displayed most frequently across your product’s screens and components.  

Dark and light primary variants 

Your primary color can be used to make a color theme for your app, including dark and light primary color variants. 

### Secondary color

A secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your product. Having a secondary color is optional and should be applied sparingly to accent select parts of your UI. 

_Secondary colors are best for:_
* Floating action buttons (Behavior & states)
* Selection controls, like sliders and switches
* Highlighting selected text
* Progress bars
* Links and headlines

& more. 

### Dark and light secondary variants

Just like the primary color, the secondary color can have dark and light variants. Normally, a color theme uses your primary color, a secondary color, and dark and light variants of each color. 

### Surface, background, and error colors

_Surface, background, and error colors typically don’t represent the brand:_
* Surface colors affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus. 
* The background color appears behind scrollable content. The baseline background and surface are one and the same. 
* Error color indicates errors in components, such as invalid text in a text field. The baseline error color is well defined. 

### Color palette 

A color palette foundation helps to create consistency in the way we use/choose colors in products, as well as ensure AA compatibility by thoughtfully pairing background and foreground colors. This means that components with various color options like badges, lozenges, and tags will have a more harmonious feel to them. Additionally, using the color palette will keep consistency when customizing charts, text, annotations, and roadmaps.

#### Primary palette

A primary palette uses bright colors to bring boldness to the brand and is used in logical ways throughout product and marketing to guide the eye and highlight the important bits. Typically, pepper warmer, secondary palette colors throughout to soften the experience and to impart confidence and optimism.

#### Secondary palette

A secondary palette contains a variety of colors to keep things fresh and interesting. Typically, lean on these colors more frequently when brand awareness is high, or on properties where we control the surrounding environment. When used in conjunction with our primary palette, these colors make every moment feel on-brand.

## Usage

The following guidelines outline when to use colors in a product. We've developed a color system that helps users find people, identify status, see actions, to locate help, and to indicate the next steps. The consistent use of color keeps cognitive loads low and makes for unified and engaging user experience.  

### Color system

The color system helps users find people, identify status, see actions, locate help, and to indicate the next steps. The consistent use of color in our products keeps cognitive loads low and makes for unified and engaging user experience. 

### Principles
* Consistent - Color should be applied throughout a UI consistently and be compatible with the brand it represents.
* Distinct - Color should create a distinction between elements, with sufficient contrast between them. 
* Intentional - Color should be applied purposefully as it can convey meaning in multiple ways, such as relationships between elements and degrees of hierarchy. 

### States
> Color can provide information about the state of an app, its components, and elements.  

_This includes:_
* Current state of an element or component, such as whether a button is enabled or disabled 
* Changes in the state to an app, component, or element 

Color should be noticeable when indicating state changes, as subtle differences in color may be missed. It’s best to indicate a change of state in more than one way, such as by displaying an icon or moving the location of an element. 

## Accessibility

Using various forms of contrast is the most important consideration when making user-friendly color and interface choices. Awareness of standards and best practices is the key to accessible color selection. 

The color families in the Axway palette contain ten values from 10 to 100. White and Black sit outside those values. Black text is WCAG AA accessible on colors ranging from 10 to 50. White text is accessible on colors from 60 to 100. 

## Corporate Colors & Palette 

The Axway color palette is inspired by the optimism, drive, and desire that teams feel when creating and building new things. 

The corporate color palette brings a unified and recognizable consistency to Axway’s products and interfaces. This consistency is grounded by a set of well-defined rules on how to work with the DS component library and the brand vision in the context of dark and light colors.

### UI Component Colors

The following theme of colors (primary & secondary) and their variations are used for the Axway UI Components in our Platform, Products & APPs.

__In Axway they are defined as follow:__
* __Axway Dark Teal__ – stands for all primary actions & components.
* __Axway Dark Gray__ - stands for all secondary actions & components.
* __Axway Plum__ - stands for all tertiary actions & components.
* __Axway Light Gray__ - stands for all behavior & states, used for UI components.

### Semantic Colors

Semantic colors denote standard value states (such as good, bad, or neutral). Each color has the same basic meaning in all contexts. 

__In Axway they are defined as follow:__
* __Axway UI Green__ – stands for all successful actions & states.
* __Axway Gold__ - stands for all warning actions & states.
* __Axway Red__ - stands for all error actions & states, used for destructive processes.

_Use semantic colors if:_
* Need to highlight an important status.
* Need to validate fields using form field validation.
* Your app needs message handling.
* Need to use the value states for a control.

#### Examples
> TBD

### Behavior & Interaction states
!> Should be finalized

In addition to the enabled state, the five other primary interaction states have been defined. 

To emphasize a specific interaction, use strong color contrasts on content that a user has interacted with, relative to content a user hasn’t. 

To emphasize selected elements, use strong color contrasts on those elements. 

#### Hover 

Hover states have their own tokens. Potentially, these colors could fall outside of the core palette steps and act as “half steps” between two adjacent colors.  

#### Active 

The active state is two full steps lighter for values between 100 and 70 and two full steps darker for values between 60 and 10.  

#### Selected 

The selected state is one full step lighter for values between 100 and 70, and one full step darker for values between 60 and 10. 

#### Focus 

The focus state usually appears as a Blue 60 border in the light theme and as a White border in the dark theme. 

#### Disabled 

Disabled components are unavailable for interaction, so they don’t receive hover or focus and are not subject to WC3 contrast compliance standards.
