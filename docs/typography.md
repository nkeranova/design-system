## The Type System

> Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

## Type scale

> The type scale is a combination of eight styles that are supported by the type system. It contains reusable categories of text, each with an intended application and meaning.


| Scale Category | Typeface | Font | Size | Color | Case |
| -------------- | -------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| H1 | System Default | Light | `2.25em` | `#575757` | Sentence |
| H2 | System Default | Regular | `2 em` | `#000000` | Sentence |
| H3 | System Default | Regular | `1.75em` | `#000000` | Sentence |
| H4 | System Default | Medium | `1.5em` | `#000000` | Sentence |
| Title | System Default | Medium | `1.25em` | `#000000` | Sentence |
| Body | System Default | Regular | `1em` | `#000000` | Sentence |
| Button | System Default | Medium | `0.875` | | Sentence |
| Caption | System Default | Regular | `0.75em` | `#575757` | Sentence | 


## Applying the type scale 

### Headlines 

> In the type scale, headlines span from a range of 1 through 5. Headlines are the largest text on the screen, reserved for short, important text or numerals to call out specific areas on a screen.


| Scale Category | Usage |
| -------------- | ----- |
| H1 | H1 is used as a page header. H1 is used once on a page but never twice. |
| H2 | H2 is reserved for section headers. Each page may have several sections that are headed by an H2 title. |
| H3 | H3 is used to break down H2 sections into more sections if applicable. |
| H4 | H4 is used to break down H3 sections into more sections if applicable. May not be used frequently. |

### Title 

The title is smaller than headlines. They are typically reserved for medium-emphasis text that is shorter in length.

### Body 

Body text is typically used for long-form writing as it works well for small text sizes. The body may have also different text styles to emphasize certain words or sentences.


| Text Style | Attribute | Value |
| ---------- | --------- | ----- |
| Bold | Typeface <br>Font <br>Size <br>Case <br>Color | System Default <br>Bold <br>`1 em` <br>Sentence case <br>`#000000` |
| Italic | Typeface <br>Font <br>Size <br>Case <br>Color | System Default <br>Regular Italic <br>`1 em` <br>Sentence case <br>`#000000` |
| Underline | Typeface <br>Font <br>Size <br>Case <br>Color | System Default <br>Regular <br>`1 em` <br>Sentence case <br>`#000000` |
| Text Link | Typeface <br>Font <br>Size <br>Case <br>Color | System Default <br>Bold <br>`1 em` <br>Sentence case <br>`#337AB7` |

### Button

Button text is a call to action used different types of buttons (such as text, outlined and contained buttons) and in tabs, dialogs, and cards.

Button text is typically an all caps sans serif.

### Caption

Caption and overline text (text with a line above it) are the smallest font sizes. They are used sparingly to annotate imagery or to introduce a headline.
